    <p class="info">Hi everyone! I'm from Argentina but currently live in Chile. I'm married to a wonderful woman, Sheila, and we have two sons aged 13 and 1 and a half. We also have one in the way, another boy.</p>

    <p class="info">I'm pursuing a major in Applied Technology. Last semester was hard for me, I dropped out of some courses and didn't get my first certificate. Why? Life. <strong>I learned that we cannot plan life. Upsides and downs will be in our way, whether we want them or not.</strong> I'm excited to expand my knowledge of web design. I love technology and learning new stuff in any technology field.</p>

    <p class="info">About my job, I'm the sales director of a small sign business. I like it, and I helped improve a lot of processes by the use and creation of technology tools, from using excel sheets to building the company's website. I hope we can be united as a class and build and learn a lot together!</p>
    
    <p class="info">Here's a photo of me and my family. We got sealed last November!</p>
